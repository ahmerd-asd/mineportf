            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hi, I’m Ahmad Shaaibu Danbaba, a Level 3 Information and Communication Technology student at Northwest University, Kano, fueled by a lifelong curiosity for technology. Growing up surrounded by the intricate world of electronics at my father’s business, Diil Autos, where he’s an engineer and owner, I developed a passion for circuit design and the dream of one day building my own robot. My fascination with web design sparked from exploring countless websites, inspiring me to create my own user-friendly interfaces using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. With over a decade of hands-on experience troubleshooting and repairing automotive electronics, I’ve sharpened my problem-solving skills and attention to detail, which I now channel into crafting seamless digital experiences and exploring IoT innovations. My ambition is to become a renowned businessman, engineer, and developer, creating a groundbreaking tech product of my own. When I’m not coding or tinkering with circuits, I’m playing tennis, reading tech blogs and novels, or immersing myself in the wonders of animal life and nature.</p>
